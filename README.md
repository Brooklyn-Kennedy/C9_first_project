This is a collection of the work I've done whilst taking the CODE Lancashire Skills Bootcamp. All code is intended for learning and my (Brooklyn Kennedy, reachable at tjskennedydm@gmail.com) submission to complete my course. If you want to use my code, please send me an email so we can chat about it!
